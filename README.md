# headphones-shop

In this project, I built an e-commerce website for "Hear Better", a ficticious shop specialized in selling headphones and earphones. The style was based on the [website concept](https://www.behance.net/gallery/80392909/AXEL-ARIGATO-Website) designed by [Dima Oxygen](https://www.behance.net/dimaoxygen) for the store "Axel Arigato".  This is part of the [Microverse curriculum](https://www.microverse.org/#world-class-curriculum). The result can be seen in [this live webpage](https://raw.githack.com/luis-novoa/headphones-shop/development/index.html).
