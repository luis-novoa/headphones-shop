# headphones-shop

In this project, I built an e-commerce website for "Hear Better", a fictitious shop specialized in selling headphones and earphones. The style was based on the [website concept](https://www.behance.net/gallery/80392909/AXEL-ARIGATO-Website) designed by [Dima Oxygen](https://www.behance.net/dimaoxygen) for the store "Axel Arigato".  This is part of the [Microverse curriculum](https://www.microverse.org/#world-class-curriculum). The result can be seen in [this live webpage](https://luis-novoa.github.io/headphones-shop/).

If you want to that, you can fork this project clicking the "Fork" button in the repository's page, which will create a repository named "<yourUserName>/headphones-shop".
